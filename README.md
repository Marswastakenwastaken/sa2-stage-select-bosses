## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows
  * Linux running Wine should also work but this tool is not designed for or tested under Linux.
* [Sonic Adventure 2 - Steam Version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/213610/Sonic_Adventure_2/)
  * There are minor differences between the different platform releases but in general learning the pieces on 1 is enough to know them on all
  * That said, this tool is intended for the Steam version, and requires the steam version of the game to be running alongside on the same machine.
* [SA Mod Manager](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager/releases/latest)
	* And all of its dependencies
